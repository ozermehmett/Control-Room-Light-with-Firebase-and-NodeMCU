# Room Light Control with Firebase and NodeMCU
This project demonstrates how to control a room light using Firebase and NodeMCU (ESP8266). It consists of a NodeMCU board connected to a servo motor that controls the light switch. The state of the light is updated based on the data received from Firebase.

## Features
- Turn the room light on and off remotely using a mobile app.
- Real-time synchronization between the mobile app and the NodeMCU board via Firebase.
- Automatic adjustment of the servo motor position to control the light switch.

## Technologies Used
- NodeMCU (ESP8266): The NodeMCU board is used to control the servo motor and interact with Firebase.
- Firebase: The Firebase Realtime Database is used to store and sync the state of the light.
- MIT App Inventor: The mobile app is created using MIT App Inventor to send commands to Firebase.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Set up the NodeMCU board and connect the servo motor to the designated pin.
2. Create a new Firebase project and obtain the necessary Firebase credentials.
3. Update the NodeMCU code with your Firebase credentials and Wi-Fi information.
4. Build and install the mobile app using MIT App Inventor or any other suitable platform.
5. Run the NodeMCU code and ensure it is successfully connected to Firebase.
6. Launch the mobile app and establish a connection with Firebase.
7. Use the mobile app to control the room light and observe the changes in real-time.
